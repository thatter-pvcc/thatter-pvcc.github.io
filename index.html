			<h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
			<p>Most websites on the Internet store small pieces of data on your device called cookies. 
			They can store information such as login credentials, shopping cart contents, tracking data for personalized advertisements, etc. 
			Cookies are, undoubtedly, crucial in personalizing user experiences and website functionality. However, the usage of cookies raises privacy and security concerns.

			<h2>Are there any real benefits to cookies?</h2>
			<p>According to the Internet Health Report (2018), websites save consumer data to personalize and improve their experience. 
			For example, remembering what language is preferred or the items in an online shopping cart. 
			These are often called “first party” cookies and make websites more convenient to users.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>What if it was without your knowledge?</h2>
			<p>
			Unfortunately, alongside “first party” cookies lie “third party” cookies. 
			The Electronic Privacy Information Center (2025) states that these types of cookies allow for online tracking and mass data collection of consumers. 
			Users have little knowledge that their data is being automatically collected while they browse. 
			Lena Cohen (2024) specifies that websites use code from third parties to load advertisements and other useful utilities. 
			The problem arises when a user visits a website, and a third-party cookie is assigned to them with a unique identifier.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			This becomes a greater issue when the user then visits another website that uses the same third-party company. 
			That company can log the identifier from the earlier cookie. That means third-party companies can profile users based on what they browse. 
			The Electronic Privacy Information Center (2025) acknowledges that the everyday user could not avoid mass data collection in a reasonable way. 
			They agree that being a participant of modern society requires being connected to the Internet. However, it should not be necessary to sacrifice privacy. 
			The average user is unable to control what data third-party companies collect and share about them. Once that data is collected, it is impossible to erase. 
			</p>

			<h2>What problems could arise from their use?</h2>
			<p> 
			Again, Lena Cohen (2024) explains the consequences of online surveillance through third party cookies. 
			As previously mentioned, they allow for companies to build profiles of Internet users which can be used for targeted advertising or sold to other companies. 
			People’s browsing history includes sensitive information, such as financial statements, medical conditions, gender, race, religion, the list goes on. 
			Data brokers can gather this information and sell it without knowledge or consent of the user. 
			Unfortunately, anyone can buy it once it has been leaked from government agencies to your neighbor next door. 
			Even if this fact does not concern people, it is important to note that this information can certainly be used against them. 
			For example, landlords targeting individuals based on their race and financial state using information they bought. 
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>What can be done about this?</h2>
			<p> 
			The Internet Health Report (2018) suggests that using private browsing or ad blockers is an effective way to prevent third-party trackers. 
			Ad blockers prevent third-party cookies by blocking third-party traffic like advertisements. 
			Private browsing does not store cookies in browsing history and clears data after it is closed. 
			On that note, clearing browsing history is another way to prevent tracking or unwanted cookies. 
			Although, software like ad blockers present another issue because they take away the revenue of content creators and legitimate business owners. 
			Unfortunately, there is no clear solution to this problem without creating new ones. 
			The most important thing is to learn about third-party cookies and understand what is happening behind the scenes. 
			</p>

			<h2>Should a website be allowed to record cookies on your computer?</h2>
			<p> 
			In conclusion, websites should be allowed to record cookies on user’s computers if they have the consent from the user browsing the website. 
			First-party cookies are almost necessary for most websites. They improve consumer experience by providing convenience and greater functionality. 
			However, it is important to acknowledge that third-party cookies have tainted the Internet. 
			Third-party companies profit from the sensitive information they collect from users that know no better. 
			This can be prevented if people educate themselves about this issue and inform themselves of methods to prevent their data being collected.
